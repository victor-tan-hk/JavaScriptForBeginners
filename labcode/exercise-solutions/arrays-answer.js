There is a new condition in place on the use of Shopee Coins.

The customer can only pay using Shopee Coins if this is included as one of his possible methods of payment AND the item(s) that he wishes to use Shopee Coins on has a rating of 4.5 and above.

Modify the previous method that you implemented to check again whether the customer is able to pay for part of his overall purchase using Shopee Coins alone. The cash equivalent of the Shopee Coins is obtained by multiplying it with the Coin conversion rate.

Call the object method and change the values for the possible methods of payment and rating for specific items being purchased to verify that it works correctly.
